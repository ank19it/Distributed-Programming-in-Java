_## This is thrid and last course in [Parallel, Concurrent, and Distributed Programming in 
Java Specialization by Rice University in Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/pcdp)_

An introductory course of  Distributed Programming in Java by Rice university in Coursera 
Where I've learnt the follwing skills:
1. Distributed map-reduce programming in Java using the Hadoop and Spark frameworks
2. Client-server programming using Java's Socket and Remote Method Invocation (RMI) interfaces
3. Message-passing programming in Java using the Message Passing Interface (MPI)
4. Approaches to combine distribution with multithreading, including processes and threads, distributed actors, and reactive programming


This repository contains 4 mini-project with above mentioned technology, where
1. The First mini project exhibits __Page Rank with Spark__
2. The Second mini project exhibits __File Server Using Sockets__
3. The Thrid mini project exhibits  __Distributed Matrix Multiply using Message Passing__
4. The Fourth mini project exhibits __Parallel File Server using Multithreading and Sockets__
